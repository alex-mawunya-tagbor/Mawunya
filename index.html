               data-section1-text="When we were posted to the school, we saw an opportunity to create a more conducive and engaging learning environment for the learners we served and we took it. In one of the classrooms, we provided a custom 4x13-foot white marker board alongside a 4x4-foot movable graph board to elevate the teaching and understanding of mathematics, especially in areas like graphing. To enhance these resources, we included essential supplies like whiteboard markers and duster. But our efforts didn't stop there. We recognized that the traditional, worn-down brooms could be affecting students' posture, so we added standing brooms to improve ease of use, along with rubbish collectors to maintain cleanliness"

               data-section2-text="During my internship at Labolabo D/A Basic School, I encountered learners with a remarkable curiosity for technology. These were not just students, but young innovators eager to solve real-world problems. I realized my role went beyond teaching, it was about creating access. I connected them to Yamoransa Model Lab 6 - Peki Avetile, a space where creativity and innovation are nurtured. One learner, Robert, stood out. On my last day, he surprised me with an invention: a solar-powered portable Bluetooth speaker designed to emit sound privately, so as not to disturb others. He had observed that I often worked late at night and wanted to solve a problem I hadn't even voiced. Impressed, I shared his work with Yamoransa Model Lab 6, who later invited him to join their community. Despite initial challenges, including parental concerns about traveling from his place to the lab, persistence and collaboration led to a breakthrough. Robert eventually showcased his innovation at the  Annual Impact Roundtable Discussion and Robotics Competition (AIRTAD) 2024 which consist of 12 Yamoransa Model labs in Ghana and 1 from Gambia, representing the lab on a national stage, and later pitched at a continental forum for young African innovators under the UNDP. Today, he continues to explore IoT and robotics, proving that opportunity unlocks talent."
